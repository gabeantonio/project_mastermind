# Mastermind

PROCESS

1. I plan on creating two scripts for this project: One script that will handle the interface on the command line, and one script that will handle the game logic.
2. mastermind.py will contain the game logic while initialize_mastermind will take care of the terminal interface.
3. Starting with mastermind.py, I first want to initialize a hidden variable that will hold the random 4 number combination from the API.
4. Then, I want to also create a list that will hold the player's guesses as the game progresses.
